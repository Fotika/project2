A very simple encryption method that has been in use for thousands of years is called a Caesar cipher. Recall that the character set for text is ordered as a sequence of distinct values. This encryption strategy replaces each character in the plain text with the character that occurs a given distance away in the sequence. For positive distances, the method wraps around to the beginning of the sequence to locate the replacement characters for those characters near its end. For example, if the distance value of a Caesar cipher equals two characters, the string “california” would be encrypted as “ecnkhqtpkc”. To decrypt this cipher text back to plain text, you apply a method that uses the same distance value but looks to the left of each character for its replacement. This decryption method wraps around to the end of the sequence to find a replacement character for one near its beginning.
Finish coding the decrypt()function of Caesar Cipher Application which is stored in the Caesar Cipher.py file located in Project 7 folder on Canvas. The application prompts the user for the distance to be used. It then asks for three one-word, lowercase messages which are stored in a python set. The messages are then encrypted based on the distance inputted. The application uses the decrypt() function to decrypt the contents of the set. The program output should be formatted as shown in the Sample Run.
